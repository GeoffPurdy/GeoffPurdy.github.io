I have to say I am completely in love with programming again! &nbsp;I probably spent 60 hours coding this past week and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />There were times a few years ago while sitting in endless conference calls with faceless names on other continents that I really believed the IT industry wasn't for me. <br /><br />There have been times in the recent past while taking MOOC's from Stanford, MIT, and the like that I had become convinced that I just didn't have the intellectual horsepower to keep up in this field.<br /><br />There were times while studying on my own that I seriously believed that I had ADD or a learning disability of some sort preventing me from absorbing knowledge as quickly as I needed to.<br /><br /><br />But I love the format of this class. &nbsp;There is expert help available pretty much 24/7 so annoying problems don't become roadblocks. &nbsp;And best of all there are a bunch of cool people in the same boat and in physical proximity whom you can support and look to for support. &nbsp;For the first time in a decade or more, I feel confident and in the driver's seat of my career.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DnEigm-1eC0/VCAu87DjjPI/AAAAAAAABlw/g2c6jsoUHKc/s1600/class.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DnEigm-1eC0/VCAu87DjjPI/AAAAAAAABlw/g2c6jsoUHKc/s1600/class.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br />
