Monday, just a couple days ago, was the last day of summer and I was feeling on top of the world. &nbsp;Two days later I am seriously questioning if I can keep up with the pace of the course.<br /><br />282&nbsp;<a href="http://rubykoans.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Koans</a>&nbsp;for homework due today. &nbsp;Despite my best efforts I am still less than halfway there. &nbsp;My neck hurts, my back hurts. &nbsp;Even my finger tips and eyes hurt. &nbsp;On the upside during week 1 my brain hurt but now it feels better.<br /><br />I am also now officially the old guy in the class. &nbsp;The previous official old guy dropped out. &nbsp;I thought about bringing Geritol to class but I was concerned it might offend those older than me. &nbsp;Now that I am the old guy, I think I am clear to go forward on that plan.
