Thoughts on Javascript while observing others learning JS for the first time:   <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">OH: "Don't hate the Javascript, hate the DOM."<br />— Geoffrey Purdy (@geoff_purdy) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoff_purdy/status/528529827943702528">November 1, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> The above paraphrases a quote from one of my favorite people Douglas Crockford:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: 'PT Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">On the other hand, there was the Document Object Model, also known affectionately as the DOM. It is what most people hate when they say they hate JavaScript. Most of the people who say they hate JavaScript don’t know JavaScript, might have never seen JavaScript, but they’ve felt the DOM alright. If you don’t know what the difference is and you say, “JavaScript is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen,” you’re not talking about JavaScript, you’re talking about the DOM. The DOM is the browser’s API. It is the interface. It provides JavaScript for manipulating documents. --&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/03/09/video-crockonjs-4/" target="_blank">http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/03/09/video-crockonjs-4/</a></span></blockquote><br />&nbsp;and bastardizes a quote from another of my favorite people Ice-T:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Don't hate the playa, hate the game. &nbsp;--&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcIH5DQY6U8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcIH5DQY6U8</a></blockquote>
