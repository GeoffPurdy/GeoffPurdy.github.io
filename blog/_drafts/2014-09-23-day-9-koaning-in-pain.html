Next up is&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan" target="_blank">Koans</a>&nbsp;or more specifically&nbsp;<a href="http://rubykoans.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Koans</a>.<br /><br />I hate ruby koans. &nbsp;Yesterday morning I had never heard of koans, now I hate them with an all consuming passion. &nbsp;I have worked on these for the last 24 hours and completed 41. &nbsp;There are 282 total and we are expected to complete all of them by tonight.<br /><br />The tl;dr version of ruby koans is that you are given a ruby program that won't run because there are 1000+ intentional errors in the code. &nbsp;The student fixes them one at a time and attempts to build the codebase to get to the next error/koan. &nbsp;What separates koans from a badly broken program is that the error messages are wrapped with Zen-like witticisms like "The path to enlightenment requires the defenestration of one's laptop." &nbsp;Okay, I made that one up but they are similar.<br /><br />I would so much like to spend this time reading&nbsp;<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516178.do" target="_blank">The Ruby Programming Language</a>&nbsp;instead of slogging through these koans. &nbsp;I think I may bag the koans and do exactly that. &nbsp;Did I mention how I feel about koans?
