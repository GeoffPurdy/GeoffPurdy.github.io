This week is shaping up to be a poor showing for me at The Iron Yard. &nbsp; HTML and CSS - how hard could it possibly be? &nbsp;Apparently very hard. &nbsp;Back in my day, one could write an HTML page in vi and that was a-okay. &nbsp;Now-a-days one needs <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)" target="_blank">Sass</a>, <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" target="_blank">middleman</a>, <a href="http://yaml.org/" target="_blank">yaml</a>, <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby" target="_blank">embedded ruby</a> and a handful of ruby gems to product that same result. &nbsp;Or in my case a result that looks far worse than simple hand coded HTML.<br /><br />On a side note, I enjoyed <a href="http://john.do/bravo-inside/" target="_blank">Iron Yard partner John Saddington's post</a> on his <a href="http://everyday-carry.com/" target="_blank">Every Day Carry</a> yesterday. &nbsp;Look for something similar from me soon.<br /><br /><br />
