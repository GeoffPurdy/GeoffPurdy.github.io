Jumped out of bed and refactored my homework again. &nbsp;Apparently while I was refereeing 1st and 2nd graders soccer game, eating dinner, and playing tooth fairy my brain was figuring out ways in which my first draft of the homework was lacking.<br /><br />Realizing my Ruby code looks more like Perl than Ruby. &nbsp;Or maybe some bastard child of Perl and an unknown object-oriented c-like language like JS or Java. &nbsp;During the homework review I realize other peoples' code looks a lot more Ruby-like. &nbsp;Although I am writing code in Ruby, I seem to be bringing idioms from something other than Ruby.<br /><br />We have gone over some <i>lint</i> tools which should help point out where I am straying from Ruby idioms.<br /><br /><h4>Maslow's Hammer</h4><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"</i><i>--&nbsp;Abraham Maslow</i></blockquote><br />Also reflecting on to what extent I am exercising what little I previously knew versus new learning. &nbsp;At times it seems like I am falling back on the familiar toolset I brought with me, but I believe I am gradually incorporating new tools.
