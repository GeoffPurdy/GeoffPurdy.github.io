The reader may notice from the absence of blog posts that I slacked off a little over the weekend. &nbsp;I ended up doing all three homework assignments by Saturday with the intent to clean one up for a really well done final submission. &nbsp;I submitted what I felt was the best of the three and got some extra sleep Sunday night. &nbsp;Probably a good idea.<br /><br />I awoke with an epiphany about functions and how they relate to unit testing. &nbsp;I think my left brain had needed some down time to catch up with my right brain.
