<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /><br />We begin with zero because, of course, counting starts at zero.  Like celebrating my newborn daughter's zeroeth birthday.  (see photo at bottom of post)<br /><br /><br /> Day 0 began as one might expect addressing administrative and logistical issues.  Then moved into a discussion of programming.<br /><br /><br /> Our instructor, Clinton, then gave a mind blowing example of hacking a binary sort algorithm into a ternary sort by taking advantage of the fact that a double beam balance doesn't just produce an output of heavier or lighter but heavier, lighter, or equal.  It took a while to wrap my brain around it but very cool stuff.<br /><br /><br /> We had a bonus lecture from John Saddington, serial entrepreneur and one of the Iron Yard partners.  He gave a lot of honest answers about entrepreneurship.  This is the kind of thing in which one rarely gets to participate outside a class like this or small conference.<br /><br /><br /> The last part of classroom time was dedicated to software installation.  The kind of stuff that drives me insane at home because, of course, I installed some weird thing ages ago that makes the instructions not work as expected on my machine.  Very nice to have help and get any issues resolved quickly.<br /><br /><br /> Then came the homework.  Blackjack 21.  I have never played blackjack.  I though I understood it.  Player and dealer get two cards.  Player optionally selects a third card.  Whomever gets closes to 21 with out going over wins.  Then I read the rules.  I was very wrong.  It is far more complex than I believed.   Couldn't we do "go fish" for our first project?  Off to try to understand blackjack.  More tomorrow... <br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g9EPXsiM2Lc/VBdzy5LJxQI/AAAAAAAABlE/t0_HUP8ogPw/s1600/dad_baby_2_s.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g9EPXsiM2Lc/VBdzy5LJxQI/AAAAAAAABlE/t0_HUP8ogPw/s1600/dad_baby_2_s.JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><span style="color: #141823; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3199996948242px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #141823; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3199996948242px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #141823; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3199996948242px;"><br /></span></span>
