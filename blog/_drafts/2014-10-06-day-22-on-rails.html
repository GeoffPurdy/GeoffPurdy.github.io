It is the start of week four and the class begins the eponymous Rails. &nbsp;Everyone has been looking forward to this and I don't think anyone was disappointed.<br /><br />I hadn't used Rails before and it is about what I expected. &nbsp;The framework gives the programmer a lot for "free" which would require a lot more setup in J2EE or other web frameworks I have used.
