I could spend time with my family (I have already been doing that). &nbsp;I could do some things around the house that had been out-prioritized like changing lightbulbs and mowing the grass.<br /><br />Or, I could redo the weekend assignment in another language like Clojure. &nbsp;That would be cool. &nbsp;I'll see if any of my fellow students need help and if they don't then Clojure it will be. &nbsp;I should also go back and finish the ruby koans that I didn't complete earlier in the week. &nbsp;I am not looking forward to that.<br /><br />The weekend assignment was our choice of several games the most difficult of which, I was warned, was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>. &nbsp;Life is something I had been meaning to <a href="https://github.com/GeoffPurdy/conway_life" target="_blank">write </a>for years so I jumped at the chance. &nbsp;I found&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a>&nbsp;to be very helpful. &nbsp;The TDD methodology allowed me to write fairly extensive tests around boundary and edge cases for translating 1D arrays to 2D and back. &nbsp;This is the kind of thing that historically would have driven me crazy with off-by-one errors. &nbsp;But once I had the tests running, I didn't encounter such errors at all. &nbsp;I would guess TDD reduced development time by at least 50% for me on this project.<br /><br /><br />
