What <b>is </b>code school anyway?<br /><br />Is code school simply a professional service? &nbsp;Code school will provide x hours of instruction and y hours of personal help and z hours of mentoring then work their network and find you a job?<br /><br />Or, is it a College / University model in which, although one pays for the privilege of attending, the burden is on the student to meet the standards of the school or instructor?<br /><br />Or, as <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/post/107238344528/instructor-clinton-driesbach-my-theory-on-code" target="_blank">suggested recently</a>, is it an apprenticeship model?<br /><br /><br />Modern apprentices get paid for their services. &nbsp;They never pay their master's salary. &nbsp;Apprentices of old were often in involuntary servitude (let's not go there). &nbsp;Maybe someday if people get paid to attend code school instead of paying for code school, that dynamic may change.<br /><br />There are aspects of a College / University model in a code school. &nbsp;There are standards to be met and a "graduation" of sorts upon completion. &nbsp;But in my experience at a code school, any standards that exist are both unwritten and highly subjective. &nbsp;That isn't the model in institutions of higher education. &nbsp;And accredited institutions can confer degrees to students. &nbsp;Code schools cannot do that.<br /><br />That leaves us back where we started - the obvious and correct answer. &nbsp;Code schools are professional service providers. &nbsp;They advertise the services they provide and the cost of those services. &nbsp;The students are the customers who, after paying the price should rightfully expect the services to be rendered as described.<br /><br />That dynamic should be very straightforward, but it isn't. &nbsp;When you go to code school, you plunk down five figures for the privilege of being there and for the next three months are necessarily and voluntarily unemployed. &nbsp;I cannot speak for all code school attendees, but for the ones I know this translates into approaching the end of code school with no money and no job prospects other than your putative post-code-school career - the road to which travels through the good graces of code school staff. &nbsp;At that point, the code school instructor and administration have a great deal of control of your future. &nbsp;Not just your career, but the next time you can afford to eat or put fuel in your car. &nbsp;And that can greatly distort the customer - vendor relationship.<br /><br /><br /><br />
