Cohort 2 enjoyed a relaxing reunion lunch today in Downtown Durham - where the majority of the Cohort 2 Rails Engineering grads are now working. &nbsp;That's a placement rate around 80% five months post-graduation. &nbsp;I'll give credit where credit is due - those are good numbers. &nbsp;Way to go TIY!<br /><br />Word is that uptake has been good for the Cohort 3 grads as well. &nbsp;35% - 50% hired six weeks post-graduation. &nbsp;Also very good numbers if accurate.
