Today was a good day for me at The Iron Yard. &nbsp;Perhaps it is no coincidence that today is the first day in a long time we haven't had to use Rails. &nbsp;I spent the day blissfully writing javascript in a text editor. &nbsp;I had forgotten how much I love Javascript and plain old text editors.
