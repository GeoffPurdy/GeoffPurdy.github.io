12:03 AM &nbsp;Jumped out of bed, fired up the Macbook and refactored my homework I had submitted the previous afternoon. &nbsp;Much better now. &nbsp;Back to sleep...<br /><br />8:45 AM &nbsp;I am reflecting on the value of stepping away from code. &nbsp;The format of an intense code school doesn't allow a lot of time for quiet reflection away from one's code, but sometimes that is what one needs. &nbsp;Stared at my code for 2 hrs yesterday afternoon got nowhere. &nbsp;Stepped away for the entrepreneurs pitches for a couple hours, went home and played w my kids. &nbsp;Then went back to the code and fixed it in literally 5 minutes.<br /><br />8:56 AM Also reflecting on how comfortable I feel using Ruby after - 2 days!?! &nbsp; Perl-like in many ways. &nbsp;Clojure-like in some.<br /><br />9:00 AM &nbsp;<a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/" target="_blank">Strangeloop</a>&nbsp;starts today in St. Louis. &nbsp;Clinton is here in Durham. &nbsp;I wonder if he is bummed. &nbsp;I could ask him, but that would be too obvious. &nbsp;Instead I will observe his behaviour today for any signs of being bummed.<br /><br />9:59 Clinton recommends the book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670" target="_blank">Code Complete</a><br /><br /><br />
