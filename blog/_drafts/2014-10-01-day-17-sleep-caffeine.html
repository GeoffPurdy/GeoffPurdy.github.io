I am discovering that caffeine is not a substitute for sleep. &nbsp;That throws a wrench in my plan.<br /><br />We have moved on from just plain Ruby which I really enjoyed to CSS and something called <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" target="_blank">middleman </a>which seems to be a mini version of Rails. &nbsp;Thus far it just looks like Ruby randomly interspersed in HTML.<br /><br />Up to yesterday, the class was pretty much covering old ground for me. &nbsp;I know how to program and learning Ruby is a relatively small step. <br /><br />We are now entering material that is relatively new for me. &nbsp;I butted heads with CSS about a year ago when I unsuccessfully attempted to build a website for my company using it and HTML. &nbsp;My experience then was that HTML is easy and CSS is a horrible pain in the ass. &nbsp;Trying to position *anything* where you want it on a webpage using CSS is painfully futile (much less position *everything*). &nbsp;Now that I have about 2.5 hours of CSS classroom instruction under my belt, nothing has changed. &nbsp;Which is unsurprising given that the amount of time and effort I spent trying to figure out CSS on my own makes another 2.5 hours seem pretty insignificant.<br /><br />I ended up getting help from one of our TA's, the illustrious Chet Corey with getting my middleman environment set up. &nbsp;Then I turned to my old friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5uTBT0HMK8" target="_blank">Professor YouTube</a> for help. &nbsp;Professor YouTube's suggestion to create div's and set the background color of each to a unique color was a huge help. &nbsp;Wish we had done that in class. &nbsp;Trying to figure out what was where based solely on the positioning of the text was an exercise in futility for me.
