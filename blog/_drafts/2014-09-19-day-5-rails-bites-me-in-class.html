Last day of week 1. &nbsp;I am REALLY enjoying the class thus far. &nbsp;Something about this style of learning appeals to me. &nbsp;I have spent a great deal of time coding but haven't been bored.<br /><br />Today was a little frustrating. &nbsp;I realized that I have never programmed in a language that will allow declaration of variables as liberally as ruby. &nbsp;And the errors are manifested at run time. &nbsp;Typical error for me is something like:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">@things = new Array(2)<br />@thing[0] = "Thing 1"<br />@thing[1] = "Thing 2"</span></blockquote><br />See the problem? &nbsp;I named the array in the plural, but used the singular accessing the individual elements. &nbsp;Bad habit of mine. &nbsp;That gets caught pretty quickly in the other languages I have used. &nbsp;Ruby happily runs the code then complains you are calling method []= on nil. &nbsp;Because you created a brand new object when misspelling the array name. &nbsp;Easy fix, but also easy to overlook.<br /><br />Method return types have also bitten me a few times. &nbsp;I suspect a fancier IDE might be a big help with this.
