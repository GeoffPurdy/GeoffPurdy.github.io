Many <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-shows-employers-struggle-shortage-130000477.html" target="_blank">articles</a> have been written recently about the "shortage" of programmers. &nbsp;These articles generally express in vague terms how companies would hire more programmers if they could find them, but the articles rarely go into relevant details in terms of wages, skillset, duration of employment, etc.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Numerous code "bootcamps" have stepped in to fill the perceived void. &nbsp;The pitch is that the student ponies up a five figure tuition, busts their butt for 12 weeks and exits a qualified Jr Dev earning a lot: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job" target="_blank">12 Weeks to a 6-figure Job</a></div><div><br /></div><div>It sounds good in theory. &nbsp;How does it work in practice? &nbsp;I attended a code school last fall. &nbsp;Over two months after graduation, here is an update. &nbsp;Out of fourteen students in job placement:<br /><table><tbody><tr><td>Full-time paid employment</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Internship or unpaid employment</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Haven't found a job or internship</td><td>7</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><div><br />Honestly, that isn't bad in and of itself. &nbsp;Job searches and interview processes take a while. &nbsp;In a vacuum, the remaining seven would likely find something in a few months. &nbsp;Contacts are made, jobs open up and the local market could absorb seven new programmers. &nbsp;Except, a month from now, that same code school graduates an additional 45 students into the local job market. &nbsp;That same local job market that absorbed only half of a class of 15.<br /><br />And there will be another class of 45 three months later, plus another code school just started that will also be pumping graduates in to the market. &nbsp;It would seem that the bottleneck is not sourcing new programmers, but a paucity of entry level positions at the actual companies claiming to have a shortage of programmers. &nbsp;What companies really seem to want in quantity is (based on their job postings) senior level programmers with years of experience who are fully current on the latest technologies.<br /><br />So, how does the code school market respond to slow uptake of its graduates by the market and an inability to place at least half of its graduates? &nbsp;Aggressive expansion!<br /><br />Let's crunch some numbers. &nbsp;A twelve week class with fifteen students paying twelve-thousand dollars a seat grosses $180K. &nbsp;Subtract ~$25K for the instructor, ~$5K for TA, ~$3K for a suitable classroom, plus fixed costs of ~$20K for administrative staff, ~$6K for a student lounge and maybe ~$1K for utilities.<br /><br />Offering a single class in four 12-week sessions per year nets $480K and each additional class nets an additional $510K. &nbsp;So, running three classes in parallel four sessions per year nets a cool <b>$1.5 million in annual profit</b>.<br /><br />Wow, that is a lot of money. &nbsp;But code schools claim to be meeting an urgent need for developers. &nbsp;Well, the corporate partner of the code school I attended currently employs <b>only one graduate of their own code school</b> - as a part-time apprentice earning less than the&nbsp;<a href="http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/locations#/united-states" target="_blank">average hourly wage of a worker at Walmart</a>. &nbsp;Not quite six figures.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
