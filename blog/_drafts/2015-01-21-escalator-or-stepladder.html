My The Iron Yard cohort 2 colleagues have been on my mind a lot lately. &nbsp;The Iron Yard's pitch is, among other things that you will leave <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/" target="_blank">a professional junior-level programmer</a>. &nbsp;However, instead of exiting into jr dev jobs, graduates seem to be fighting tooth and nail for internship level positions. &nbsp;Jr dev jobs seem to be out of reach.<br /><br />I think students entering the program, myself included, view the program as largely deterministic. &nbsp;Come to class, pay attention, do the work, put in the 80+ hours a week and three months later you emerge a qualified jr. dev. &nbsp;Like an escalator, you start at point A and time T later you exit at point B. &nbsp;Of course, barring some failure on the part of the student like failing to attend class, failing to do the work or put in the hours.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kbfDMzQN4M4/VL-xRlSacsI/AAAAAAAABuw/rdvepiywXHU/s1600/escalator.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kbfDMzQN4M4/VL-xRlSacsI/AAAAAAAABuw/rdvepiywXHU/s1600/escalator.gif" height="144" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />In retrospect the expectations should be different. &nbsp;One needs to evaluate their own starting point - their personal point A - and where they want to end up - personal point B. &nbsp;And then figure out if three months at TIY will get them there.<br /><br />For example, consider places you want to work. &nbsp;Do they advertise internships for non-university students? &nbsp;Do they have Jr. Dev positions advertised? &nbsp;Is x years of experience or y degree a hard requirement to be considered? <br /><br />In some cases, TIY may be just the ticket. &nbsp;Maybe you are established in a company and want to transition to a developer role. &nbsp;Maybe you are starting at ground zero and want to get an internship. &nbsp;I think in these cases the finite boost provided by a code school may be just the right amount of education and demonstration of committment.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IxTskrC1vGg/VL-x9zn9JcI/AAAAAAAABvI/VRjf0-lRObg/s1600/stepladder.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IxTskrC1vGg/VL-x9zn9JcI/AAAAAAAABvI/VRjf0-lRObg/s1600/stepladder.jpg" height="320" width="213" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">But the code school boost is finite and relative to point A. &nbsp;Code school won't grant you a degree nor add years to your work history. &nbsp;If graduating TIY isn't going to get you where you need to be to acheive that goal, then you need to find another path or re-evaluate your point B. &nbsp;Sometimes a step ladder is the wrong tool for the job.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aY1LuWygGaQ/VL-xmRXzz1I/AAAAAAAABvA/Lb0b4610sns/s1600/Stuck-After-Falling-Off-A-Step-Ladder.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aY1LuWygGaQ/VL-xmRXzz1I/AAAAAAAABvA/Lb0b4610sns/s1600/Stuck-After-Falling-Off-A-Step-Ladder.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />Finally, what does your local job market look like for devs in general? &nbsp;If companies are fighting to attract and retain engineers, then they are likely to be more flexible in their hiring process and more receptive to code school grads. &nbsp;If hiring is slow for devs and / or your region has a lot of experienced devs in the job market, then the bar is set that much higher for everyone.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0zZMSeyLbiE/VL5r2t5UyCI/AAAAAAAABug/XSLBU5PHEkk/s1600/jump.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0zZMSeyLbiE/VL5r2t5UyCI/AAAAAAAABug/XSLBU5PHEkk/s1600/jump.gif" /></a></div><br /><br />P.S. &nbsp;I can't NOT include this last high jump gif ...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7uiq-5dhnMQ/VL_BWxWUfTI/AAAAAAAABvg/gOo3iGLivqY/s1600/high-jump-fail.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7uiq-5dhnMQ/VL_BWxWUfTI/AAAAAAAABvg/gOo3iGLivqY/s1600/high-jump-fail.gif" height="182" width="320" /></a></div><br />
