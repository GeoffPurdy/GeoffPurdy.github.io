I didn't finish the homework for the third day in a row which I am not really happy about. &nbsp;What I had completed at 5:05 PM when I left the classroom was essentially what I submitted at 11:50 PM. &nbsp;Having a life seems to get in the way of the bootcamp format of this course. &nbsp;If I were willing to become a homeless, stateless&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad" target="_blank">digital nomad</a>&nbsp;, I think I could have a 100% in the class thus far. &nbsp;But the difference between a 100% and a respectable passing grade likely are not worth the costs of ignoring my wife and kids for 13 weeks and reneging on any commitments I made before enrolling in this class.<br /><br />On a positive note, we are moving into some new territory for me - unit testing. &nbsp;I recall using the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Turing language</a>&nbsp;at UNC in the mid-90's. &nbsp;Turing allowed one to specify preconditions and postconditions when entering and exiting functions. &nbsp;The professor told us this was going to be a Big Deal in the Future but I really did't encounter the concept again until unit tests in Extreme Programming around 2000.<br /><br />On another positive note, I like unit tests. &nbsp;And&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a>&nbsp;worked very well for this project. &nbsp;I had done a 2 day TDD workshop a few years ago and I found the resulting code to be excessively verbose, inefficient, and poorly thought out compared to a top down design. &nbsp;In the case of something very simple and mathematical like&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/GeoffPurdy/currency_converter" target="_blank">CurrencyConverter</a>&nbsp;, TDD gave a very clean design and implementation.<br /><br /><br />
