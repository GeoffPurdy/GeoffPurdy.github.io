<br />No instructors or TA's on site today so students have the run of the space. &nbsp;Most of the class trickled in over the course of the morning. &nbsp;This weekend's assignment is challenging for me because of a) being new to Ruby and b) BlackJack has a fairly complex set of rules and strategies. &nbsp;Challenging but managable. <br /><br />I feel for the students who are brand new to programming. &nbsp;Getting hit with programming, Ruby, &nbsp;git, OOP, and OO analysis all in the course of a week has to be traumatic. &nbsp;I suspect that wrestling with the problem domain is preparing the students to see the value in tools we will cover in coming weeks: &nbsp;OOP, unit testing, debugging tools, modules, and libraries / frameworks. &nbsp;Hopefully nobody is freaking out.<br /><br />My good intentioned attempts to help other students may be backfiring. &nbsp;It occurred to me that most students don't know OOP so me talking about creating objects and deciding how they will interact may have just added to the confusion.<br /><br />
