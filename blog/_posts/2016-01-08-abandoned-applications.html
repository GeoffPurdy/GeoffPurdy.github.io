Much is made of abandoned carts in the eCommerce space. &nbsp;One seldom hears about abandoned applications on a company's careers page. &nbsp;Presumably these careers pages and online application processes exist because companies wish to attract talented employees to their companies.<br /><br />Yet, I am amazed at how inefficient and badly broken the application process is for many companies.<br /><br />For instance, the following is from a top 15 company on the Fortune 500. &nbsp;The software imported my resume, duplicated every position, quietly refused to delete the duplicates, and blocked my application from proceeding until I diligently crossed every "t" and dotted every "i" for each duplicate position.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b5btYdEIw9o/Vo_ybOaejRI/AAAAAAAASrs/7BoICCZIXuc/s1600/Screenshot%2B2016-01-08%2Bat%2B12.23.49%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="105" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b5btYdEIw9o/Vo_ybOaejRI/AAAAAAAASrs/7BoICCZIXuc/s320/Screenshot%2B2016-01-08%2Bat%2B12.23.49%2BPM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Or there are the annoying examples of required data entry, for the sake of data entry. &nbsp;The software already looked up that North Carolina is in the US, yet it requires the user to manually enter the same information again in a separate field before proceeding.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dwbXljAIe8/Vo_yX1WXvnI/AAAAAAAASrk/xlgim2fZziM/s1600/Screenshot%2B2016-01-08%2Bat%2B12.20.33%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="59" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dwbXljAIe8/Vo_yX1WXvnI/AAAAAAAASrk/xlgim2fZziM/s320/Screenshot%2B2016-01-08%2Bat%2B12.20.33%2BPM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Let's not overlook mandatory, irrelevant, impossible-to-find information. &nbsp;What was your salary twelve years ago? &nbsp;Your GPA for the class you took after college fifteen years ago. <br /><br />And stuff that is stupid obvious. &nbsp;That job you started in 1999 and left in 2001 - is that your<b> current</b> position?<br /><br />That company in San Francisco, California. &nbsp;Was that San Francisco, California, USA? &nbsp;Or San Francisco, California, Albania? &nbsp;Or San Francisco, California, Afghanistan?<br /><br />On one hand this is a good thing. &nbsp;These companies clearly are in desperate need of help from people with my skills. If I make it through their impenetrable application process.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br />I did survive the application process. &nbsp;Further research reveals that this application system is Taleo, a company formed in 1996 and acquired by Oracle in 2012 for $1.9 billion dollars. &nbsp;Yes, Billion with a "B". &nbsp;Taleo - 1996 called and they want their UI back. <br /><br />
