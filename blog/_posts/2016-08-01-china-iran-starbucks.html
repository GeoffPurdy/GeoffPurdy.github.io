<br />If you are not concerned about using open wi-fi, you should be. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Watch<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibF36Yyeehw" target="_blank"> this talk from Moxie Marlinspike at DefCon</a>.<br /><br />I normally run encrypted VPN's at places like Starbucks to reduce the privacy risks of open wi-fi and an untrusted network. &nbsp;However, in the past couple weeks I have noticed normal VPN connections are being blocked at Starbucks.<br /><br />Fortunately, this can be worked around by running a Stealth VPN which still works nicely.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GWBKzFOpG8E/V59J3hBAI6I/AAAAAAAAUlE/LN5-WfyhMjY4OllJThTwSO6q6BFjuvgmACLcB/s1600/stealth.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="227" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GWBKzFOpG8E/V59J3hBAI6I/AAAAAAAAUlE/LN5-WfyhMjY4OllJThTwSO6q6BFjuvgmACLcB/s320/stealth.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Stealth VPN's are designed for users in countries where internet access is heavily monitored, blocked and censored.<br /><br />The inability to set up a normal VPN at Starbucks seems to have come about at the same time as<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279292" target="_blank"> Starbucks announcement that they were blocking porn on public wi-fi.</a> &nbsp;I spend a lot of time working at Starbucks. &nbsp;I have seen a lot of weird stuff at Starbucks. &nbsp;I have never, ever seen anyone viewing porn at Starbucks.<br /><br />Is Starbucks going to force the average customer to risk compromising their online privacy to address a strawman non-issue created by <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279292" target="_blank">Enough Is Enough?</a><br /><br /><br /><br />
