<br />I listened to the radio for the first time in long time this morning. &nbsp;<a href="https://wknc.org/" target="_blank">88.1 WKNC</a>

<br> Normally if I am listening to something in the car it is a podcast or an audiobook or music from a playlist I selected.  Something I already knew about and chose to download. 

<br>Under the right circumstances, there is a refreshing aspect to someone else choosing, because you are likely to be exposed to material you would not have selected yourself.  And you may discover new genres you enjoy as a result. 

<br>By the time I arrived at work, I set presets for all the local college radio stations:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wknc.org" target="_blank">WKNC (NC State)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wxdu.org"  target="_blank">WXDU (Duke)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wxyc.org"  target="_blank">WXYC (UNC Chapel Hill)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wncu.org"  target="_blank">WNCU (NC Central)</a></li>
</ul>
