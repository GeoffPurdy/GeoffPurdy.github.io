<br>A couple weeks ago I picked up some new responsibilites at work.  Time consuming, low tech and (I am told) routine work, not the kind I welcome.  I will omit the specifics because they are unimportant but it is work that, in its current form, requires sysadmin involvement so it legitimately cannot be bounced back to it's origin.

<br><center><i>Why don't you document it and send it to the L1 support team to handle?</i>

<br><i>Why don't you automate it?</i></center>

<br>These are questions I have fielded from coworkers.  All reasonable suggestions and consistent with the "Automate Everything" mantra of DevOps. 

<br>My response is reflected in a quote from author Tim Ferris: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/331945-never-automate-something-that-can-be-eliminated-and-never-delegate" target="_blank"><em>Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else's time instead of your own...<em></a>

<br> Goal #1 is to <b>eliminate</b>.  Ideally process or code changes will be made so these tasks don't need to be performed at all.  By automation or otherwise.

<br>Goal #2 would be to automate, but automation isn't free - just preferable and more cost effective than human intervention.

<br>Goal #3 is delegate to dedicated support staff.  I want to respect their time and delegate only that which cannot be automated nor eliminated.
