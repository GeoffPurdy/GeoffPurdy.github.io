For those unfamiliar with the co-working trend, one leases a "seat" in an open space. &nbsp;Not a specific seat, just the right to sit at any single open seat of their choice. &nbsp;The environment does not persist from day to day. &nbsp;At some point during the night, anything left out is removed by housekeeping and the environment is re-initialized for the morning. &nbsp;The net result of this is that a co-worker necessarily must pack in all their stuff for the day and pack it back home each and every day. &nbsp;Co-working is a popular choice for techie types who need little more than a computer and a network connection to do their work.<br /><div><br /></div><div>This morning my usual zombie-like shlep from the parking lot to the American Underground&nbsp;@Main was interrupted by a chance encounter. &nbsp;As I entered the sidewalk, another person entered from across the street and formed up along side me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Good morning." &nbsp;"Good morning." I replied.</div><div><br /></div><div>I awaited the inevitable request for money that normally follows engaging a poorly groomed person carrying a large backpack with various items hung and lashed to outside of an overstuffed pack on the street in Downtown Durham. &nbsp;But no request was forthcoming.</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked at the ground. &nbsp;Our two shadows marched down Main St. in the low morning sun like two through-hikers on the Appalachian Trail.</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked in a shop window. &nbsp;My reflection looked back at me. &nbsp;Bed head, water bottle hung from a carabiner, lunch bag hung from a second carabiner, overstuffed backpack containing all the contents of a small office.</div><div><br /></div><div>We arrived at the American Underground. &nbsp;I opened the door. &nbsp;"You coming in?" "No." he replied with a shake of the head as he continued east on Main St. &nbsp;Probably headed to Bull City Co-working.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7a3M3ovqbzI/VNDXz1NaYII/AAAAAAAABwI/WXkKYn2rlcA/s1600/dt990308dhc0.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7a3M3ovqbzI/VNDXz1NaYII/AAAAAAAABwI/WXkKYn2rlcA/s1600/dt990308dhc0.gif" height="196" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div>
