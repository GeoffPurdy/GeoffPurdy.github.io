Here's something I didn't expect to be writing: &nbsp;I like interviewing for jobs.<br /><br />How often do you get to sit down with a team of people from some other company for an an hour or two and talk about their business - their goals, the challenges they face, past successes and failures?<br /><br />Unless you are a consultant, the answer is probably not very often. &nbsp;Rarely does one get a peek under the hood into the guts of someone else's business.<br /><br />But it is a very enlightening experience, &nbsp;these teams are faced with generally similar sets of problems and they have taken different approaches to solving them. &nbsp;Often there are no clear right or wrong choices - rather costs and benefits to be weighed based on the needs of the business. &nbsp;Actions, consequences, data, analyses.<br /><br />The process has definitely provided a fresh perspective. &nbsp;And fresh insights. <br /><br />For example, I use my work laptop almost exclusively as a portal into "the cloud." &nbsp;I'll save the details for another post, but that can actually be a pretty expensive choice. &nbsp;If I need a development system, I spin up an appropriate VM in AWS EC2 or GCE and connect over a VPN or SSH tunnel. &nbsp;Which is great when you are a startup getting those instances for free. &nbsp;But if you are an established business paying list price, that's a few hundred dollars a month in costs. &nbsp;Multiply that by a few dozen developers and your business is spending a lot of money.<br /><br /><br />
