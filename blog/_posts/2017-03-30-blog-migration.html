<br />Welcome to <a href="https://geoffpurdy.net/" target="_blank">geoffpurdy.net</a>

<br> It is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> site hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.io" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> using a custom domain.  The theme is courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme" target="_blank">Panos Sakkos</a>.

<br>Despite the goodness of Github Pages support for Jekyll, HTTPS is unsupported for custom domains.  The workaround for that is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/" target="_blank">putting the Github Pages site behind CloudFlare CDN</a>.  Sign up for an account, a few DNS changes and <em>voila</em> HTTPS.

<br>Email for the domain is handled by <a href="https://zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho</a>

<br>Possibly the best part, all of the above can be had for <b>free</b>.

<br>The background image is a photograph I took at the <a href="http://www.lifeandscience.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Life and Science</a> in Durham.

<br>My old blog was <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41387?hl=en" target="_blank">exported from google blogger as xml</a>. Then converted to jekyll with the <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll-import ruby gem</a>.
