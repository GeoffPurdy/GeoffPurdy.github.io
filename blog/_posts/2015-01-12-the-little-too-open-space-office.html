Today is my first day at The American Underground at Main St. (AU@Main) in the "bullpen" coworking area:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eIcV-WQwKz0/VLPwETd8yRI/AAAAAAAABuM/jnruEUl1T-I/s1600/IMG_2773.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eIcV-WQwKz0/VLPwETd8yRI/AAAAAAAABuM/jnruEUl1T-I/s1600/IMG_2773.JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The jury is still out on the open workplace concept. &nbsp;I haven't spoken with anyone this morning, yet I already know basically everything about the woman sitting near me including a great deal of stuff that should only be between her and her gynecologist.
