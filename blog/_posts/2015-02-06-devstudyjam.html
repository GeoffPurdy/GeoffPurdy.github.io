<br />There has been a lot of <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/03/cochrane_on_edu.html" target="_blank">discussion</a> in recent years about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCS</a> will change future education. <br /><br />I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of non-traditional education and as such was excited to check out something new -&nbsp;<a href="http://developerstudyjams.com/" target="_blank">Google Developers Study Jams</a>&nbsp; The tl;dr version is free, in-person study groups based on online course content. &nbsp;This seems like a really good model to me. &nbsp;One gets excellent instruction from a single polished, expert source which is viewable any time, any number of times. &nbsp;But there is also the social motivation and benefits of a co-located group.<br /><br />I have enrolled in many MOOCS. &nbsp;Completed maybe 30% of those I started, and passed about 50% of those. &nbsp;My recent experience at The Iron Yard codeschool brought in to focus the importance of both a workspace and a face-to-face peer group as support in completing the material. &nbsp;As I see things, the big downside to a The Iron Yard model is cost - five figures USD. &nbsp;The current codeschools are expensive because you are paying for the content - some expert is lecturing you in person three hours a day four days a week. &nbsp;As I have&nbsp;<a href="http://geoffreypurdy.blogspot.com/2014/10/why-i-almost-decided-not-to-continue-at.html" target="_blank">written previously</a>, I see a lot of cost but not a lot of value in live lectures.<br /><br />Enter the Study Jam model. &nbsp;Course content is online via&nbsp;<a href="http://udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. &nbsp;Workspace is donated (by&nbsp;<a href="http://twotoasters.com/" target="_blank">Two Toasters</a>&nbsp;in our case). &nbsp;Pizza is funded by&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>. &nbsp;Students work through one lesson per week then meet weekly for a few hours to work / discuss / troubleshoot / network.<br /><br />The first part of Study Jam was an (unintentional) selection filter which I barely passed. <br /><br />Quest Objective 1: &nbsp;Find the meetup<br />Two Toasters is right around the corner from where I work. &nbsp;I arrived for Study Jam a few minutes early to discover - no more Two Toasters - just an empty office suite. &nbsp;Out came my phone, pulled up a PDF of the ticket and got the address. &nbsp;Walked to the address on the ticket and found a crowd of geeks gathered outside a locked door at the American Tobacco Campus. &nbsp;Through the glass door, we could see Two Toasters (they had moved to a new location as of a few weeks ago) but we could not get in. <br /><br />Quest Objective 2: &nbsp;Gain entry to the building<br />I am proud to say that, being familiar with ATC I knew that one could enter the Cuban restaurant next door, exit the rear, go down the hall and open the doors from the inside. &nbsp;That is exactly what I did to thunderous applause from the crowd outside.<br /><br />Quest Objective 3: &nbsp;Get inside Two Toasters<br />Once inside the ATC, we were greeted by frosted glass double doors adorned with fresh Two Toasters vinyl appliques. &nbsp;Locked double doors. &nbsp;The crowd of engineers mulled what to do. &nbsp;We checked other doors - all locked. &nbsp;We pressed buttons - none gave us access. &nbsp;We tried key cards on the reader - all rejected. &nbsp;Smart phones came out - people searched for ways to contact Two Toasters - Twitter, Google+, Facebook, email, telephone. &nbsp;There was a way in. &nbsp; We would find it. <br /><br />Then the crowd parted as someone stepped forward, stood squarely in front of the glass obstacles, raised their fist and rapped three times on the glass. &nbsp;A murmur of surprise and anticipation spread through the crowd of engineers - the ancient practice of knocking - someone had double majored in engineering *and* history. &nbsp;The doors promptly opened and a young woman with pink hair escorted us to the meeting space.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aa644gXMFBU/VNS6S6GIpzI/AAAAAAAABwY/QAijpL08NRA/s1600/Achievement.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aa644gXMFBU/VNS6S6GIpzI/AAAAAAAABwY/QAijpL08NRA/s1600/Achievement.png" height="60" width="320" /></a></div><br />
