<br /><br />Geoff's First Coffeemandment:<br /><br /><i>1: He who emptieth the last cup must filleth the vessel. &nbsp;For what good be the vessel lo it containeth no coffee?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><br /></i>This seems to be universal to the human condition. Everywhere I have ever worked, there is SOMEBODY who kicks the coffee at 9:30 and for whatever reason leaves it that way.
