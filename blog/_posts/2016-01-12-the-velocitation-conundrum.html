<blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Focus. Speed. I am speed.</b> <i>-- L. McQueen, 2006</i></blockquote><br /><br />I had a thought provoking conversation today. &nbsp;Having spent most of last year in an accelerator -&nbsp;<a href="http://thestartupfactory.co/" target="_blank">The Startup Factory</a>, moving fast has become the norm. &nbsp;Getting traction quickly is all that matters.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6ibKT5mt5Mg/VpVwTytidpI/AAAAAAAASuE/QHADcdcwx2k/s1600/Screenshot%2B2016-01-12%2Bat%2B4.28.34%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6ibKT5mt5Mg/VpVwTytidpI/AAAAAAAASuE/QHADcdcwx2k/s320/Screenshot%2B2016-01-12%2Bat%2B4.28.34%2BPM.png" width="312" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />And that thinking doesn't only apply to small startups. &nbsp;Any company engaged in a hypercompetitive B2C industry seems to share a similar mantra.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Companies rarely die from moving too fast, and they frequently die from moving too slowly.</b> <i>&nbsp;-- R. Hastings, 2011</i></blockquote><br /><br />But what if you are winning. &nbsp;Or maybe you already won. &nbsp;No longer the scrappy startup, now you are the 800 lb gorilla. &nbsp;Can your company afford to lift off the gas?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tMkky5-6hRQ/VpVyIanXwXI/AAAAAAAASuQ/xnegmuf7vVc/s1600/finish.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="129" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tMkky5-6hRQ/VpVyIanXwXI/AAAAAAAASuQ/xnegmuf7vVc/s320/finish.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Speed is often expensive. &nbsp;Amazon AWS is fantastic for its low startup costs, excellent tooling, and comprehensive features. &nbsp;But it is also a relatively expensive infrastructure for larger, more mature organizations.<br /><br />Startups are all about CAC vs LTV of a customer. &nbsp;But the LTV of the customer increases if the cost of serving that customer decreases. &nbsp;Thus containing cost by eliminating unnecessary flexibility can be the difference between a viable business and a failure.<br /><br /><br />
